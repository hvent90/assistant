# Docs

Historical design documents. The codebase is the source of truth for current behavior — consult these for *why* decisions were made, not *how* things currently work.

- `2026-02-01-background-assistant-design.md` — Original architecture (signals, context assembly, two-agent model). Start here for foundational understanding.
- `plans/` — Chronological implementation plans. Useful when investigating why a feature was built a certain way.
